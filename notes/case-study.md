## 1. Summary

**CS-1: Tele System (TAS).** A composite service that orchestrates three atomic services (*Drug*, *Medical Analysis*, *Alarm*) for home care of patients with chronic conditions, with diabetes as the canonical clinical example. *TAS* runs on the *ReSeP* platform and uses *ActivFORMS* as the adaptation engine. Weyns and Calinescu introduced *TAS* in 2015 [1] as a reference exemplar for the *SAS* research community, and the case has evolved through two later revisions (Weyns and Iftikhar 2016 [13], Cámara et al. 2023 [10]), giving a rich, decade-long baseline for like-for-like comparisons.

**Selection rationale (lens).** This work fixes the trade-off lens to *Performance* vs. *Availability* and uses *TAS* as one of two validation cases where conflicting workload requirements naturally highlight that trade-off. *TAS* is framed by its authors as a *Reliability* vs. *Cost* exemplar; we interpret its four-metric *Quality Attribute* (*QA*) catalogue (failure rate, response time, cost, throughput) under the *Performance* vs. *Availability* lens without rewriting the source numbers.

*TAS* discharges five recurring *SAS*-literature weaknesses directly:

- lack of rigorous evaluation methods;
- insufficient focus on alternative *QAs* beyond *Performance*;
- limited trade-off management across multiple *QAs*;
- limited design-decision transparency;
- limited guidance on how reported results are achieved.

The case answers all five through explicit numeric targets (failure rate `R1 ≤ 0.03 %`, response time `R2 ≤ 26 ms`), a documented *Reliability* vs. *Cost* trade-off with two effector strategies, and a clean *MAPE-K* (Monitor-Analyse-Plan-Execute-Knowledge) split that makes design-decision provenance traceable.

**Bounded system (Coombs [5]).**

- **What.** A composite service-based self-adaptive application orchestrating three atomic services (*Drug*, *Medical Analysis*, *Alarm*), wrapped by a *MAPE-K* feedback loop realised in *ActivFORMS*.
- **Where.** The *ReSeP* runtime as a research platform; clinically intended for chronic-disease home-care deployments.
- **When.** Original publication 2015 [1]; mid-generation revision 2016 [13]; second-generation analytical revision 2023 [10].
- **Who.** D. Weyns, R. Calinescu, M. U. Iftikhar (system + engine); J. Cámara, R. Wohlrab, D. Garlan, B. Schmerl (analytical revision); patient (stakeholder); clinical operator (secondary stakeholder).

**Runeson-Höst conditions [4].** *TAS* satisfies the five conditions for case-study research in software engineering: an empirical enquiry (the published experiments and stochastic-timed-automata (*STA*) simulations of [1] and [13]), a contemporary phenomenon (*SAS* engineering), a real-life context (chronic-disease home care), multiple sources of evidence (papers, public code, *UPPAAL* models), and an unclear phenomenon-to-context boundary (*MAPE-K* loop interleaved with the managed workflow).

**Original-authors' research gap.** *TAS* was introduced to fill a well-documented gap in the *SAS* research community: the absence of shared, reproducible exemplars allowing researchers to compare adaptation approaches on equal footing. The exemplar standardises three things: a common service workflow, five generic adaptation scenarios drawn from the service-based self-adaptation literature, and four *QA* measurement metrics that let different research teams produce directly comparable figures on the same baseline.

**Scope of this note.** No methodology-specific lens is applied here; the selection rationale is recorded in `ADR.01` under *Design Notes*.

## 2. Technical Specifications

**Case type.** Following Runeson and Höst [4], CS-1 is treated as a **descriptive case study with explanatory extension**. The descriptive part documents the architecture, platform, scenarios, and *QA* profile. The explanatory extension addresses causal claims about how *Retry* and *Select Reliable* affect reliability and cost under identical input profiles.

**Research questions (RQ).**

- **RQ.1:** What is the architectural structure of *TAS*, including its components, connectors, workflow, and runtime platform?
- **RQ.2:** How does *TAS* realise self-adaptation, and what is the separation between the managed subsystem and the managing subsystem through probes and effectors?
- **RQ.3:** How do the two adaptation strategies (*Retry* and *Select Reliable*) compare on the four quality attributes defined in [1] (*Reliability*, *Performance*, *Cost*, *Functionality*) and the three requirements in [10] (`R1`, `R2`, `R3`)?
- **RQ.4:** Which architectural tactics from the Bass 3rd-edition catalogue [6] can be identified in the *TAS* design, and how are they realised through the *ReSeP* components?

**Quality attributes under study.** Reproducing Table II of [1]:

| **Attribute** | **Metric as defined by TAS**                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Reliability*     | Number of failed service invocations; Number of specific operation sequence failures; Mean time to recovery                                              |
| *Performance*     | Number of specific operation sequences exceeding allowed execution time. Cámara et al. [10] add*Service response time* as a direct performance metric |
| *Cost*            | Cumulative service invocation cost over given time period                                                                                                |
| *Functionality*   | Number of faulty process executions                                                                                                                      |

**Quantitative targets (Cámara et al. 2023).** The *TAS* exemplar as revisited in [10] Table 1b reframes the quality story as three named quality requirements:

| **Id** | **Description (verbatim from [10] Table 1b)**        |
| :----------: | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `R1`    | The average failure rate should not exceed `0.03%`       |
|    `R2`    | The average response time should not exceed `26 ms`      |
|    `R3`    | Subject to `R1` and `R2`, the cost should be minimised |

`R3` is a **conditional optimisation**: cost minimisation is only meaningful when `R1` and `R2` are simultaneously satisfied. The per-scenario thresholds that trigger adaptation at runtime are `Rfail ≥ 0.03 %` for the service-failure scenario and `tavg ≥ 27.0 ms` for the response-time-variability scenario.

**Earlier requirement framing (Weyns and Iftikhar 2016).** Seven years before [10], Weyns and Iftikhar [13] expressed the adaptation goals with different thresholds and a different optimisation objective:

|           **Id**           | **[13] 2016 framing**                                      | **[10] 2023 framing**                               |
| :-------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
|              `R1`              | `failureRate ≤ 0.15 × 10⁻³`                                | `failure rate ≤ 0.03 %`                                |
|              `R2`              | `averageCost ≤ 8 × 10⁻³`                                   | `response time ≤ 26 ms`                                |
|              `R3`              | Subject to `R1` and `R2`, **minimise `failureRate`** | Subject to `R1` and `R2`, **minimise `cost`** |
| `R3'` (three-quality extension) | Minimise `serviceTime`                                         | (not defined in [10])                                     |

The `R2` dimension changes from cost to response time, and the `R3` objective inverts. Any comparison of adaptation strategies must declare which framing it uses.

**Adaptation scenarios (Table I of [1]):**

| **ID** | **Uncertainty**                                         | **Adaptation type**                                                                           | **Target requirements**                 |
| :----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
|    `S1`    | Unpredictable environment: service failure                    | Switch to equivalent service; simultaneous invocation of several services for idempotent operations | *Reliability*, *Cost*                     |
|    `S2`    | Unpredictable environment: variation of service response time | Switch to equivalent service; simultaneous invocation                                               | *Performance*, *Cost*                     |
|    `S3`    | Incomplete information: new service discovered                | Use the new service                                                                                 | *Reliability*, *Performance*, *Cost*    |
|    `S4`    | Changing requirements: new goal                               | Change workflow architecture; select new service                                                    | *Functional*: new operation                 |
|    `S5`    | Inadequate design: wrong operation sequence                   | Change workflow architecture                                                                        | *Functional*: operation sequence compliance |

`S1` and `S2` carry quantified targets and stay within the published `WorkflowProbe` / `WorkflowEffector` set. `S3` is supported by the published effectors but is unquantified in [1]. `S4` and `S5` would need a workflow-rewriting effector that [1] does not document; they fall outside the published effector set. This reconstruction therefore centres analytical work on `S1` and `S2`.

## 3. Architectural Reconstruction

**Data collection methods.** Triangulation per Seaman [7] and Runeson-Höst [4]:

- **Independent.** Source PDFs ([1], [2], [3], [10], [13]); public *ReSeP* source code, workflow XML files, service profiles, input profiles, and *UPPAAL* models from the self-adaptive exemplars website cited in [13].
- **Indirect.** Probe and effector instrumentation hooks (`WorkflowProbe`, `WorkflowEffector`, `ServiceProfile.preInvokeOperation` / `postInvokeOperation`); *UPPAAL* simulation traces from [13] §V.
- **Direct.** Not applicable: this is an archival reconstruction, not a live observation. No new experiments are run on *ReSeP* in this work.

The reconstruction is divided into two architectural concerns per the self-adaptive-systems convention: the **Target System** (managed subsystem, the *TAS* composite service and its atomic services running on *ReSeP*) and the **Controller** (managing subsystem, the *MAPE-K* feedback loop realised by *ActivFORMS*).

### i. Logical Architecture: the TAS Workflow

From Figure 1 of [1], the composite *TAS* service executes the following workflow in response to messages from a patient's wearable device:

```
loop:
    pick task (pickTask)
    if task = vitalParamsMsg:
        MedicalAnalysisService.analyseData(data)
        if result = changeDrug:    DrugService.changeDrug(patientId)
        else if result = changeDose: DrugService.changeDose(patientId)
        else if result = sendAlarm:  AlarmService.sendAlarm(patientId)
    else if task = buttonMsg:
        AlarmService.triggerAlarm(patientId)
```

The workflow exhibits three decision points that create non-trivial failure-propagation paths: the `analyseData` outcome branches into three operation classes (`changeDrug`, `changeDose`, `sendAlarm`), and the panic-button path bypasses the analysis step entirely to invoke `triggerAlarm` directly.

**Stochastic workflow parameterisation [13].** The original [1] paper leaves the user-action probabilities implicit. Weyns and Iftikhar [13] later publish a stochastic model of the *TAS* environment that fills this gap. Each time tick the user either triggers a vital-parameters sample with probability `p_ANALYSIS` or presses the panic button with probability `p_EMERGENCY = 1 − p_ANALYSIS`. A typical evaluation setting in [13] uses `p_EMERGENCY = 0.25` (one-quarter of ticks are emergency calls). After the *Medical Analysis Service* returns its result, approximately `66 %` of the non-`patientOK` outcomes route to the *Drug Service* (`changeDrug` or `changeDose`) and approximately `34 %` route to the *Alarm Service* (`sendAlarm`). These probabilities drive the stochastic-timed-automaton simulations used to estimate expected failure rate, cost, and service time at runtime.

### ii. Runtime Architecture: ReSeP Components on the Managed Side

*ReSeP* reifies the *SOA* (Service-Oriented Architecture) principles [1]. The classes below (reproduced from Figures 2 and 3 of [1]) constitute the managed subsystem:

| **Class**        | **Role in the managed subsystem**                                                                              |

### iii. Controller: Managing Subsystem

The *MAPE-K* feedback loop in *ReSeP* is realised through two hook classes that the managed subsystem exposes and two profile classes that parameterise experiments:

| **Class**                     | **Role in the managing subsystem**                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Probe` / `WorkflowProbe`       | Senses workflow events (`workflowInvocationStarted`, `workflowInvocationCompleted`, `serviceFailed`) |
| `Effector` / `WorkflowEffector` | Manipulates workflow state (`removeFailedService`, `setPreferredService`, `changeQoSRequirement`)    |
| `ServiceProfile`                  | Hooks `preInvokeOperation` and `postInvokeOperation` to inject failure, delay, or cost behaviour       |
| `InputProfile`                    | Scripted sequence of invocations with predefined QoS requirements                                          |

The *ReSeP* effector set directly enables three of the five adaptation scenarios. Specifically, `removeFailedService` combined with `setPreferredService` implements `S1`; `setPreferredService` over response-time-annotated alternatives implements `S2`; `changeQoSRequirement` drives `S3`. Scenarios `S4` and `S5` require runtime rewriting of the workflow itself and therefore fall outside the published effector set. [1] implies full scenario coverage but does not document a workflow-rewriting effector; a follow-up extension would need to add one (for example, a `WorkflowEditor` effector operating on the `WorkflowEngine`).

### iv. Services, Profiles, and Costs

**Original 7-service catalogue (Table III of [1]):**

| **Service**              | **Failure rate** | **Cost per invocation** |
| ------------------------------ | :--------------------: | :---------------------------: |
| `Alarm Service 1`            |          0.11          |             4.87             |
| `Alarm Service 2`            |          0.04          |             9.74             |
| `Alarm Service 3`            |          0.18          |             2.65             |
| `Medical Analysis Service 1` |          0.12          |             4.43             |
| `Medical Analysis Service 2` |          0.07          |             7.84             |
| `Medical Analysis Service 3` |          0.18          |             2.78             |
| `Drug Service 1`             |          0.06          |             10.00             |

*Cost per invocation* values are expressed in the nominal units of the *TAS* exemplar; [1] does not state an explicit currency. The cost-reliability inversion is deliberate: cheaper alternatives such as *Alarm Service 3* at `2.65` per invocation have higher failure rates (`0.18`), so the adaptation engine is forced to arbitrate between *Cost* and *Reliability* rather than pick a dominant service.

**Intermediate 15-service catalogue [13].** The mid-generation revision introduces a fifteen-service catalogue (`5 AS + 5 MAS + 5 DS`), each characterised by failure rate, cost, **queue length**, and **response time** measured at runtime (Table II of [13]). The same paper defines service time as

```
Service Time = Response Time + Waiting Time in Queue
```

This decomposition is what makes the `R3'` extension in [13] target `serviceTime` rather than response time in isolation: a configuration can satisfy `R1` and `R2` and still have a high service time if pending invocations accumulate in the queue. The 2016 profile sits between [1]'s seven-service catalogue and [10]'s nine-service catalogue.

**Alternative 9-service catalogue (Cámara et al. 2023, Table 1a of [10]):**

| **Id** | **Service name** | **Fail rate [%]** | **Resp time [ms]** | **Cost [usd]** |
| :----------: | ---------------------- | :---------------------: | :----------------------: | :------------------: |
|    `S1`    | Medical S.1            |          0.06          |            22            |         9.8         |
|    `S2`    | Medical S.2            |           0.1           |            27            |         8.9         |
|    `S3`    | Medical S.3            |          0.15          |            31            |         9.3         |
|    `S4`    | Medical S.4            |          0.25          |            29            |         7.3         |
|    `S5`    | Medical S.5            |          0.05          |            20            |         11.9         |
|   `AS1`   | Alarm S.1              |           0.3           |            11            |         4.1         |
|   `AS2`   | Alarm S.2              |           0.4           |            9            |         2.5         |
|   `AS3`   | Alarm S.3              |          0.08          |            3            |         6.8         |
|    `D1`    | Drug S.1               |          0.12          |            1            |         0.1         |

Alongside the services, [10] introduces two architectural design parameters that [1] treats implicitly: `MAX_TIMEOUTS`, the maximum number of retries on a failed service call before giving up; and `timeout length`, the waiting period per attempt before a timeout is declared. These drive the design space reduced via *PCA* (Principal Component Analysis) and *Decision Tree Learning* in [10]. Two variants *TAS V1* and *TAS V2* are studied separately (Figures 6 and 8 of [10]). *V1* roots its decision tree at `MAX_TIMEOUTS < 2` with `AS3$0 = exists` as the dominant secondary split, yielding a top-reliability leaf (`1.00`) when both conditions apply. *V2* keeps the same root but elevates `AS1`, `AS2`, and `AS3` to joint influence, with leaves in the `0.89` to `0.99` range.

When a later analysis cites *TAS* service parameters, it must state which profile (`2015`, `2016`, or `2023`) it uses, and if `2023`, which variant (*V1* or *V2*), to avoid silent mixing of the four options.

### v. Adaptation Engine: ActivFORMS

Iftikhar and Weyns developed *ActivFORMS* as a runtime environment for architecture-based adaptation with formal guarantees [2], [3]. The defining property that *ActivFORMS* brings to *TAS* is that the *MAPE-K* feedback loop is specified as a *UPPAAL* timed-automata model, verified at design time, and then directly executed at runtime rather than translated into code. The guarantees established by the model checker therefore carry over to execution without the usual code-generation gap.

**UPPAAL stochastic-timed-automata models [13].** Where [1] summarises *ActivFORMS* at a high level, [13] publishes the full set of stochastic-timed-automata (*STA*) models used at runtime, distributed across five diagrams:

- `Figure 4`, **Environment model**: encodes the stochastic user behaviour (`p_ANALYSIS` vs. `p_EMERGENCY` tick, post-analysis `66 % / 34 %` branch).
- `Figure 5`, **Managed System model**: the *TAS* workflow as an *STA*, starting with `assignServices(AS, MAS, DS)` and tracking invocations via the `serviced?` signal.
- `Figure 6`, **Quality model: failure rate**: *STA* computing average failure rate from the concrete service failure rates along the executed path.
- `Figure 7`, **Quality model: cost**: *STA* computing average per-invocation cost in the same way.
- `Figure 11`, **Quality model: service time**: *STA* computing average service time as the sum of response time and waiting time in queue along the executed path (introduced when the third quality is added).

The full *UPPAAL* source is referenced by the project website cited in [13] but not reproduced in the paper.

### vi. Adaptation Strategies

Two *ActivFORMS* strategies are compared in [1]:

- **Retry.** On failure, the effector selects an alternative service from the cache and retries the operation. The retry count is bounded.
- **Select Reliable.** On failure, an equivalent service is invoked in parallel to the primary. Each operation is attempted once; at least one success is sufficient.

Both strategies rely on stateless atomic services so that parallel or retried invocations remain safe.

### vii. Headline Results

Summary of the six-step experiment, reproduced from Table IV of [1]:

| **Strategy**  | **Failure rate** | **Sequence failure rate** | **Cost** | **Invocations** |
| ------------------- | :--------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :------------: | :-------------------: |
| *No Adaptation*   |          0.18          |              0.22              |     8.12 K     |         1 561         |
| *Retry*           |          0.11          |              0.13              |     9.95 K     |         1 981         |
| *Select Reliable* |          0.00          |              0.00              |    11.04 K    |         1 984         |

*Select Reliable* eliminates failures entirely at roughly `36 %` higher cost than *No Adaptation*. *Retry* halves the failure rate at roughly `22 %` higher cost. Neither strategy dominates; the choice depends on the stakeholder's *Reliability* vs. *Cost* utility function.

Only scenario `S1` is quantified in Table IV of [1]. Weyns and Iftikhar [13] §V report a more substantial experimental setup for the same `S1`-style scenario: `10 000` invocations per experiment, `1 000`-invocation moving window, and boxplots for the relative standard error of the mean at `RSEM = 5 %` and `RSEM = 10 %`. The `RSEM = 5 %` setting roughly doubles the adaptation time of the `RSEM = 10 %` setting, which is the source-documented accuracy-versus-latency trade-off of the simulation approach.

### viii. Tactics Identified (Bass 3rd ed. [6])

The mapping is interpretive; only tactics verbatim from [6] are cited.

| **Bass tactic category (3rd ed.)**        | **Tactic**                     | **Realisation in TAS**                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Availability*: Fault Detection               | Ping/Echo, Heartbeat, Exception      | `WorkflowProbe.serviceFailed` detects failed invocations; `postInvokeOperation` raises exceptions on profile-triggered failures    |
| *Availability*: Recovery (Preparation/Repair) | Active Redundancy                    | *Select Reliable*: equivalent service invoked in parallel with the primary; consistent with the 3rd-edition definition (hot restart) |
| *Availability*: Prevention                    | Removal from Service                 | `WorkflowEffector.removeFailedService` withdraws an unreliable service from the client's cache                                       |
| *Modifiability*: Defer Binding                | Runtime Registration, Dynamic Lookup | `ServiceRegistry` and `ServiceCache` allow runtime discovery and replacement of services                                           |
| *Performance*: Resource Management            | Maintain Multiple Copies             | Multiple equivalent atomic services (*Alarm 1/2/3*, *Medical 1/2/3*) reduce contention and raise reliability                       |
| *Performance*: Resource Demand                | Control Frequency of Sampling        | `InputProfile` throttles the invocation rate of the composite service                                                                |

The *Retry* strategy of [1] does not map to a single 3rd-edition tactic. It is realised as a composition of `Exception` detection via `WorkflowProbe.serviceFailed`, `Removal from Service` via `WorkflowEffector.removeFailedService`, and `Dynamic Lookup` through the `ServiceCache`. Bass 4th edition introduces `Retry` as a named tactic under *Recover from Faults*, *Preparation and Repair*, but this work stays with the 3rd edition [6] and describes the strategy as a composition rather than renaming it.

### ix. Self-* Properties Exercised

Mapping the exemplar onto the IBM autonomic computing taxonomy, *TAS* exercises four self-* properties.

- ***Self-Healing***: discovers failures in external services through `WorkflowProbe.serviceFailed` and replaces them through `WorkflowEffector.setPreferredService`.
- ***Self-Optimization***: realised by the `Planner`'s utility function that trades off response time, failure rate, and invocation cost.
- ***Self-Awareness***: the probes continuously monitor the *QAs* listed in *Technical Specifications*, across both the [1] Table II definition and the [10] revision that drops *Functionality* and adds *Service response time* under *Performance*.
- ***Context-Awareness***: realised by the `ServiceCache`, which tracks the metrics of external service providers so that adaptation decisions depend on the current state of the environment.

### x. Cross-Source Inconsistencies

Per `ADR.06`, [1] is authoritative. The table below logs every systematic disagreement between [1], [13], and [10]. The *ActivFORMS* papers [2], [3] do not appear because they use non-*TAS* illustrative examples.

## 4. Limits

Because this is an archival reconstruction, each validity dimension is read twice. We separate (a) inherited threats from the original study and (b) threats introduced by our reconstruction.

### i. Construct validity: are we describing TAS for what it really is?

- **Inherited threat.** The *Reliability* metric counts raw failed invocations; a single sequence failure may involve several atomic-service failures. **Mitigation:** *Headline Results* tabulates both rates.
- **Threat to our reconstruction.** The Bass tactic mapping is our interpretation. **Mitigation:** only tactics verbatim from [6].
- **Residual risk.** The *Cost* metric uses nominal per-invocation prices from the exemplar, not real pricing.

### ii. Internal validity: do the causal claims actually hold?

- **Inherited threat.** [1] experiments use slightly different invocation counts (`1 981` vs. `1 984`). **Mitigation:** per-invocation normalisation preserves ordering.
- **Inherited threat.** Each strategy ran once over `500` messages in [1]. A zero-failure rate over `500` samples is not the same as zero failure probability. **Consequence:** perfect reliability claims should be read as "no failure observed in a `500`-message run". [13] §V-B extends this to `10 000` invocations.
- **Threat to our reconstruction.** We infer causal stories from [1] without re-running; any reporting error in [1] is inherited.

### iii. External validity: how far can conclusions transfer?

- **In scope.** Service-based self-adaptive systems with a composite workflow, replaceable atomic services with quantified QoS, and a *MAPE-K* loop over the workflow engine.
- **Out of scope.** Event-driven, data-intensive, or safety-critical systems where atomic operations are stateful.
- **Simplification threat.** *TAS* uses a simplified patient model. A real clinical deployment would face correlated event bursts and regulatory constraints.

### iv. Reliability: can someone else produce the same reconstruction?

- **Supports replication.** All source code, workflow XML files, service profiles, input profiles, and *UPPAAL* models are publicly available from the self-adaptive exemplars website.
- **Threat to exact replication.** The service-profile generator is stochastic but the paper does not state the random-number seed.
- **Threat to our reconstruction.** The tactic mapping and the two-abstraction-level decomposition are our interpretive choices. **Mitigation:** exposed in the *ADRs* below.

## 5. Insights

### i. Lessons on the TAS architecture

- **L1.** The explicit separation of **managed** subsystem (*CompositeService*, *AtomicService* instances, *WorkflowEngine*) from **managing** subsystem (probes, effectors, *MAPE-K* loop) is the central architectural decision that makes *TAS* reusable as an exemplar.
- **L2.** Service profiles (`preInvokeOperation` / `postInvokeOperation`) are a clean mechanism for injecting failure, delay, and cost behaviour without modifying service implementations.
- **L3.** Input profiles decouple the stimulus pattern from the system under test, which is the key reason third parties can replicate *TAS* experiments exactly.

### ii. Lessons on adaptation strategies

- **L4.** *Retry* and *Select Reliable* represent a classic *Reliability* vs. *Cost* trade-off: *Retry* is cheaper but less reliable; *Select Reliable* is most reliable but most expensive.
- **L5.** *Select Reliable* achieves perfect reliability only when the simultaneous invocation is truly independent, which *ReSeP* guarantees for stateless idempotent operations. For stateful operations *Select Reliable* would need a compensation or voting tactic.
- **L6.** *ActivFORMS* offers formal guarantees at runtime because the *UPPAAL* model is executed directly, not code-generated. This is a distinct architectural stance from code-generated controllers.

### iii. Lessons on case-study reporting

- **L7.** The published input profile as a separable artefact lets third parties replicate the exact stimulus pattern used to generate published metrics.
- **L8.** The service-profile table (Table III of [1] or Table 1a of [10]) with explicit failure rates and costs is the single most useful artefact for anyone comparing a new adaptation approach against published baselines.

## 6. Design Notes

Following Wohlin [8], we log the principal decisions that shape how this case study is framed as Architectural Decision Records (*ADRs*).

**ADR.01: Adopt TAS as the first case study.**

- **Context.** This work requires case studies on realistic self-adaptive architectures. Candidates were *TAS* (service-based), *DeltaIoT* (*IoT* / multi-hop communication, see [3]), and *EUREMA* (model-driven self-adaptation). *TAS* offers the richest QoS structure, the cleanest separation between managed and managing subsystems, and a broad adoption base that supports analytical generalisation.
- **Decision.** *TAS* is adopted as CS-1.
- **Consequences.** CS-2 focuses on a system with different structural features (federated *IoT* service discovery) to broaden analytical generalisation per Rico [9].

**ADR.02: Focus on scenarios `S1` and `S2` for analytical work.**

- **Context.** *TAS* defines five adaptation scenarios. `S4` and `S5` require workflow restructuring that changes the architecture itself.
- **Decision.** The initial reconstruction targets `S1` (service failure) and `S2` (response-time variability) for analytical work. Scenarios `S3` to `S5` are logged as extensions in the reconstruction but do not drive quantitative analysis.
- **Consequences.** Analytical focus limited to the static *ReSeP* topology.

**ADR.03: Use ActivFORMS published results as the comparison baseline.**

- **Context.** To compare any new analysis or adaptation approach against *TAS*, a baseline of observed outcomes is needed.
- **Decision.** We adopt the three outcomes from Table IV of [1] (*No Adaptation*, *Retry*, *Select Reliable*) as the baseline, with [13] §V-B as the extended-sample-size complement. Any future analysis is validated against both.
- **Consequences.** This work does not re-run the original *TAS* experiments; it re-interprets the published results. Any discrepancy between a new analysis and the published baseline becomes a research finding in its own right.

**ADR.04: Stateless atomic services.**

- **Context.** The *TAS* exemplar uses stateless atomic services for the idempotent-operation assumption. Real clinical systems have stateful drug-history records.
- **Decision.** This work preserves the statelessness assumption to keep *Select Reliable* semantics interpretable.
- **Consequences.** Stateful extensions are out of scope. A future case study could introduce a transactional atomic service to exercise additional *Availability* tactics such as `Transactions`.

**ADR.05: Two architectural abstraction levels.**

- **Context.** The *TAS* architecture has at least two meaningful abstraction levels: composite-to-atomic (the *CompositeService* calling *AtomicService* through the *WorkflowEngine*) and atomic-to-atomic peer-level substitution (during adaptation).
- **Decision.** The reconstruction documents both levels as separate views.
- **Consequences.** Any subsequent analysis (tactics mapping, *QA* evaluation, or methodology-specific follow-up) can select either view as its scope without conflating them.

**ADR.06: Source hierarchy and inconsistency policy.**

- **Context.** The CS-1 source set spans four *TAS*-specific documents that do not fully agree: the original journal paper [1], the two *ActivFORMS* papers [2], [3] (which describe the adaptation engine using non-*TAS* examples), the mid-generation complement [13] (which expands to a 15-service catalogue, adds stochastic user probabilities, and introduces the service-time decomposition), and the second-generation analytical revision [10] that adds a richer nine-service catalogue with two variants and three named requirements.
- **Decision.** [1] Weyns and Calinescu 2015 is the **authoritative source** for the *TAS* architecture, scenarios, and original experimental numbers. [2] and [3] describe the *ActivFORMS* engine and are cited only for engine semantics. [13] is a **mid-generation complement** that fills gaps in [1]: stochastic user model, fifteen-service catalogue, service-time decomposition, earlier `R1/R2/R3` framing. [10] is a **second-generation analytical revision** with a nine-service catalogue, two variants, and revised `R1/R2/R3` targets. Where [13] and [10] disagree, the *ACS* quotes both framings and names them explicitly.
- **Consequences.** Any new analysis that cites *TAS* must state which source set it uses. The evolution of the *TAS* exemplar from [1] (2015) through [13] (2016) to [10] (2023) is itself a finding: the *TAS* case study is a living artefact that the same research community has revised over roughly a decade.

**Resolved decisions (P1-P5).**

- **P1 (longer runs).** Weyns and Iftikhar [13] §V-B publish a `10 000`-invocation experiment with a `1 000`-invocation moving window and two accuracy settings (`RSEM = 5 %`, `RSEM = 10 %`).
- **P2 (random seed).** Not stated in [1], [10], or [13]. Closed as unresolvable from current sources.
- **P3 (full UPPAAL model).** [13] Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, and 11 publish the full *STA* model set.
- **P4 (`S3`-`S5` via ReSeP effectors).** Only `S1`, `S2`, `S3` supported by the published effector set; `S4` and `S5` require a workflow-rewriting effector that [1] does not document.
- **P5 (`V1` vs `V2` differences).** *V1* uses `AS3` as dominant secondary split; *V2* elevates `AS1`, `AS2`, `AS3` to joint significance. Both share the nine-service catalogue and `R1`-`R3` requirements.
